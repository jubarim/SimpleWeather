# Simple Weather exercise

# Base code:
A sample app is provided, with a remote request to OpenWeather APIs already working (for a single city, using retrofit).

You can complete the tasks using this base app or create a new one, it is up to you.

# Exercise tasks:
* When you open the app, show the name and current temperature of all brazilian's capitals.
* Add a button to manually force a refresh of temperatures.
* Handle network errors: show a message to the user with the error information (Snackbar).
* When the user clicks on a city, open a new fragment (it can be empty).
* Architecture: up to you ;-)
